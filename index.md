### Practice Final Available
The [practice final exam]({{ site.github.url }}{{ "/Practice Final.pdf" | uri_encode }}) is now available, as are its
[solutions]({{ site.github.url }}{{ "/Practice Final Solutions.pdf" | uri_encode }}).

As previously mentioned, all proofs on the final exam will be on material covered after the midterm,
although there may be high-level T/F questions about language classes studied earlier in the course.

### Course Objectives Available

If you're wondering what to expect on the final, consider looking at this class's [course objectives]({{ site.github.url }}{{ "/Computer Science 311 Course Objectives.pdf" | uri_encode }}). This document outlines what students should be able to do by the end of the term.

All proofs on the final exam will be taken from sections 3 and 4. However, these questions may
require knowledge from the previous sections. There may also be T/F questions about the language
classes studied in sections 1 and 2.

A practice final will be following shortly, and will be given out in class on 5/31.

### Practice Midterm Available

If you're looking for an example of the sorts of questions you can expect on Thursday's midterm, a
short practice test is available [here]({{ site.github.url }}{{ "/Practice Midterm.pdf" | uri_encode }}).

Solutions are available [here]({{ site.github.url }}{{ "/Practice Midterm Solutions.pdf" | uri_encode }}).

### Lecture 07 Notes Updated

In the original version, the proof that 0<sup>n</sup>1<sup>n</sup>0<sup>n</sup> was not context-free was missing a case. This has
now been rectified.

If you downloaded the notes to study, be sure to pull down a fresh copy.

### Welcome to CS 311.

This site is very much a work in progress. Expect it to get both prettier and more functional over
the first week or two.

Announcements should show up on this home page when I have something important to say. Until then,
have a look at the syllabus and the tentative schedule.
